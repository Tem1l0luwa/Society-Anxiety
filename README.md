# Society Anxiety Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the factors influencing Anxiety Levels (1–10) in society using demographic, lifestyle, and health-related data. By applying data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning models, the project uncovers relationships between stress, sleep, habits, and therapy that affect mental health outcomes.

## Objectives
- Understand how demographic and lifestyle variables influence anxiety.

- Visualize patterns across habits (smoking, alcohol, caffeine, exercise, sleep).

- Build predictive models to estimate anxiety levels.

- Provide actionable insights for mental health awareness and interventions.

## Dataset
- Size: 22,000 records

- Columns: 19 features, including:

Age, Gender, Occupation

Sleep Hours, Physical Activity, Caffeine/Alcohol intake, Smoking

Stress, Heart Rate, Breathing Rate, Sweating, Therapy Sessions

Family History, Major Life Events, Diet Quality

- Target: Anxiety Level (1–10)

## Visualizations (Power BI Dashboard)
- Overview Page → Average Anxiety Level gauge, demographic breakdown

- Demographics Page → Anxiety by Age, Gender, Occupation

- Health & Habits Page → Anxiety vs Sleep, Physical Activity, Smoking, Alcohol

- Physiological Page → Anxiety vs Heart Rate, Breathing, Sweating

- Therapy & Lifestyle Page → Effect of Therapy, Diet, Stress

## Modeling

- Machine learning models (Regression) used:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

- Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R²

## Results
- Anxiety strongly linked with stress, poor sleep, unhealthy habits, and high heart rate.

- Physical activity and therapy sessions reduce anxiety levels.

- Final Model Performance:

Train RMSE: 1.38 | Test RMSE: 1.36

Train R²: 0.69 | Test R²: 0.70

## Insights & Recommendations
- Promote stress management and better sleep hygiene.

- Encourage physical activity and balanced diet.

- Reduce reliance on alcohol, caffeine, and smoking.

- Increase access to affordable therapy and mental health services.
